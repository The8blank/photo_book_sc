        <h1>Hello i'm Samuel</h1>
        <p>
          I am a professional model based in Marseille. <br /> I have always had a
          passion for the arts, especially photography, and I have been
          fortunate enough to turn that passion into a career. <br /> <br /> As a model, I
          take pride in my ability to bring a client's vision to life through my
          work. Whether it's on the runway or in front of the camera, I am
          always striving to deliver the best possible results. <br /> With my years of
          experience, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a natural
          ability to showcase a brand's unique identity.  <br /> <br /> In addition to my
          modeling work, I am also a skilled web developer. <br /> I believe that my
          technical knowledge and artistic sensibilities work together
          seamlessly to create a well-rounded approach to my work. <br /><br /> If you are
          interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
          I am always excited to collaborate with new clients and to take on new
          challenges. <br /> <br /> Let's create something beautiful together. <br /> <br /> Thank you for
          considering me, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
